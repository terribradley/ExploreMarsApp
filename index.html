        <h1>Conception</h1>
        <p>Mars has been colononized for quite a long time, so food, shelter, and water is accesed easily.  Our users are ready to have some fun! We wanted to make an app for a variety of users. We lanted to provide for the needs of families with small children, young adullts looking for adventure, and folks looking to relax.</p>
        <p>These user case studies mostly informed the typ of housing and adventure packages that would be listable. We also wanted to design an interace that was easy to navigate and use.</p>
